dcmiodlang

dcmiodlang is the implementation of a custom DICOM information object definition
language (IODL) and a compatible transformation language, the information object
definition [transformation] skeleton language (IODSKEL).

DICOM IOD Macros, Modules, Functional Groups and their composition as IODs may
be described utilizing the IODL and can then be translated to any other repre-
sentatio (e.g. C++ source code) utilizing the IODSKEL.

Example usage of the IODL compiler application "iodc":

  Print command line options and basic usage:

    iodc --help

  Generate the C++ header and source file for the Parametric Map Image Module:

    iodc -s </path/to/dcmiodlang>/data/skeleton \
         </path/to/dcmiodlang>/iods/config.iodl \
         </path/to/dcmiodlang>/iods/parametric_map_image_module.iodl

dcmiodlang depends on the boost C++ libraries and DCMTK, which are required for
compiling the above mentioned compiler application. Don't forget to also install
DCMTK's data dictionary before using iodc, or set the environment variable, e.g.:

    DCMDICTPATH=<path/to/dcmtk>/data/dicom.dic iodc -s \
         </path/to/dcmiodlang>/data/skeleton \
         </path/to/dcmiodlang>/iods/config.iodl \
         </path/to/dcmiodlang>/iods/parametric_map_image_module.iodl
